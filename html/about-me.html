                    Hello everyone, I am a recent graduate with a Bachelor's degree earned from California State University, Long Beach. One of my hobbies that I 
                    often like to do during my spare time is playing video games. I also love being a streamer that I play a variety of games on YouTube, such as Red Dead Redemption 2, 
                    Resident Evil games, and other survival horror games on the channel. That's when I entered into the world of programming with C++ when I took a class at a community college. 
                    It turns out I have grew my passion in programming since I played video games from my childhood. 
                </p>

                    Eventually, I found my passion in being a web developer when I participated in a senior project with my group. 
                    While I worked with my group, I learned new technologies HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for web development. Apparently the name 
                    of the senior project was called, <q>Text-to-<abbr title="Database">DB</abbr>.</q> This project allows new users to add, modify, and delete databases from 
                    our website. If you want to dive into these details, click on the projects link to view the project on my GitHub page.
